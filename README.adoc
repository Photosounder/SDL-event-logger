= SDL Event Logger

== How to trigger the bug

Short-press the middle mouse button or Alt-Z to toggle the zoom-scroll mode, which relies on `SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode()` and `SDL_WarpMouseInWindow()` to achieve the effect. With the SDL 2.0.22 DLL everything should jitter all over the place as you move the mouse in this mode, not so with earlier versions.

Also, preferably with the zoom-scroll mode turned off, hold-click on the test dial control on the upper right corner, see how it also jitters as you move the mouse up and down.

Replace the DLL with different versions to see how you obtain different behaviours and events.

== Where's the SDL code responsible

The relevant SDL-specific code is found in link:rouziclib/libraries/sdl.c[sdl.c] and link:rouziclib/general/mouse.c[mouse.c]. The state of the zoom-scroll mode is in the flag `mouse.zoom_flag`. Moving the knob sets `mouse.warp_if_move` which sets `mouse.warp` when the mouse starts moving.
